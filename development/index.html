    <h1>Development</h1>
    <h3>
        For this project, I made a reactive interface based on buildings at Brown University. 
        You are able to sort the set of buildings by construction year and area, and are able
        to filter by use category of building and region of campus. You can keep a list of your
        favorite buildings. I built this website using React, which was a relatively new experience
        for me.
